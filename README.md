# knowledge-discovery-framework
Classification of diseases based on abstract medical research papers

**Knowledge Discovery Framework(KDF)** takes structured and unstructured data and gives out enriched output. The framework is capable to handle biomedical abstracts and extract genes and proteins causing the disease. Used loop back mechanism where predicted outputs for new data sets are added back to training data. Developed a web-based user interface for visualization of enriched and annotated words. </br>
Languages & Technology used: Java, Stanford Classifier, Natural Language Processing, Text Pre-processing,Feature Engineering , Feature Extraction and Multi class classification algorithms</br>
